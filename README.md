# BLE5
## System-level simulator of Bluetooth Low Energy version 5

This simulator is written in C++ and developed to work in [MiXiM framework](http://mixim.sourceforge.net/) of the [OMNeT++ engine](https://omnetpp.org/). This simulation ,which simulates the PHY and MAC layer of BLE 5, is veleoped on top of [BLE 4.2 simulator](http://cc.oulu.fi/~kmikhayl/BLE.html). The following features of BLE5 have been developed:

* New PHY layers including, **LE Coded S2**, **LE Coded S8**, **LE 2M PHY** in addition to **LE 1M PHY**.
* Chanell Selection Algorithm 2\#.
